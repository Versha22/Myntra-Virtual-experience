#  MetaCommerce: The Future of Shopping in the Metaverse

Imagine transforming the way you shop — not just scrolling through static pages, but walking through a virtual Myntra store, picking up items, and experiencing the vibe of a real mall, all from the comfort of your home.
What if shopping could be:

* Immersive, like visiting a shopping mall without stepping out? <br />
* Interactive, where you can engage with products, try them virtually, and get recommendations?<br /> 
* Cross-reality, where you own the product not just in the physical world but also in your digital wardrobe?<br />
<br />

So here we bring you "Flipkart's 3D virtual world" <br />
* A fully 3D virtual world in MetaVerse in Decentraland. <br />
* Decentraland is a 3D virtual world browser-based platform. Users may buy virtual plots of land in the platform as NFTs via the MANA cryptocurrency, which uses the    Ethereum blockchain.
* Mana Tokens - In-game ERC-20 cryptocurrency of Decentraland used to trade land and other goods(wearables,objects etc) in the virtual world.
